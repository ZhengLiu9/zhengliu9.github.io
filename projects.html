        <p>It has been long observed that temporal fluctuations of background radiation are positively
          correlated with precipitation due to the scavenging effect
          of rain and snow. Accurately estimating the temporal fluctuation
          of background radiation helps anomalous radiation source detection
          to reduce false alarm rates and improve estimation accuracy. In this research, we have applied
          recurrent neural networks to predict the background radiation level based
          on past weather and radiation data. Two datasets are prepared with
          different noise levels. Experiment results show that for the noisy dataset, recurrent neural
          networks outperform the traditional moving average algorithm; for the clean dataset,
          recurrent neural networks perform as well as the moving average algorithm.

        <p>Currently, injection sites of probes, cannula, and optic fibers in
          stereotactic neurosurgery are typically located manually. This step
          involves location estimations based on human experiences and thus
          introduces errors. In order to reduce location error and improve
          the repeatability of experiments and treatments, we have developed an
          automated locating framework to locating injection sites.
          This framework integrates a regional convolutional network
          and a fully convolutional network to locate specific anatomical
          points on skulls of rodents. Experiment results show that the proposed
          locating framework is capable to identify and locate Bregma and Lambda points (two important anatomical reference points)
          in rodent skull images with mean errors less than 500 um. This
          method is robust to different lighting conditions and mouse orientations
          and has the potential to simplify the procedure of locating injection sites.

        <p>Modeling of background radiation for the urban environment plays an
          important role in homeland security. However, background radiation is
          difficult to assess due to its spatial-temporal fluctuations caused
          by variations in soil composition, building materials, and weather
          patterns etc. To address the challenge of background radiation
          modeling, we have developed a mobile sensor network to continuously monitor
          the background radiation; we have also proposed a maximum likelihood estimation
          algorithm to decouple and estimate the background's spatial distribution
          and temporal fluctuation. Experiment results demonstrate that this
          background radiation monitoring system accurately recognizes high
          background regions in the experiment area and successfully captures
          temporal fluctuation trends of background radiation during rains. Our
          system provides an efficient solution to model the temporal fluctuation
          and spatial distribution of background radiation. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205092" target="_blank">[paper]</a></p>

         <h4><a href="#rl">Reinforcement learning for Radiation Source Detection</a></h4>
        <p>Anomalous radiation source detection in an urban environment is challenging
          due to the complex nature of background radiation. When a suspicious area
          is determined, a radiation survey is usually carried out to search for
          anomalous radiation sources. However, current survey strategies either require
          human efforts or are not efficient and flexible enough to adjust
          survey paths based on recent measurements. Reinforcement learning,
          which studies the problem of how agents ought to take the optimized
          action so that a goal can be achieved efficiently, provides an
          alternative data-driven solution to conduct radiation detection tasks
          with no human intervention. In this research, we have applied reinforcement
          learning to navigate an automated agent searching for radiation
          sources. A simulated radiation environment is constructed, and
          Q-learning approaches are applied. Preliminary results show that
          Q-learning is able to navigate the agent to search for radiation sources
          efficiently. [paper under review]</p>
