         <h4><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2018.03.005" target="_blank">Prediction of weather induced background radiation fluctuation with recurrent neural networks.</a></h4>
        <p>Background radiation estimation plays an important role in the anomalous
          radiation detection. Accurately estimating temporal and spatial fluctuations
          of background radiation helps to reduce the false alarm rate and improve the
          estimation accuracy of anomalous source location. It has been long observed
          that background radiation is positively correlated with precipitation due to
          the scavenging effect of rain and snow. This paper presents the usage of
          recurrent neural networks to predict the background radiation level based
          on past weather and radiation data. Two datasets are prepared with
          different noise levels. Experiment results show that recurrent neural
          networks outperform the traditional moving average algorithm on the
          high noise dataset; recurrent neural networks perform as well as the
          moving average algorithm on the low noise dataset. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2018.03.005" target="_blank">[paper]</a></p>

         <h4><a href="https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2293715" target="_blank">Automated location detection of injection site for preclinical stereotactic neurosurgery through fully convolutional networks.</a></h4>
        <p>Currently, injection sites of probes, cannula, and optic fibers in
          stereotactic neurosurgery are typically located manually. This step
          involves location estimations based on human experiences and thus
          introduces errors. In order to reduce location error and improve
          repeatability of experiments and treatments, we investigate an
          automated method to locate injection sites. This paper proposes a
          locating framework, which integrates a regional convolutional network
          and a fully convolutional network, to locate specific anatomical
          points on skulls of rodents. Experiment results show that the proposed
          locating framework is capable to identify and locate Bregma and Lambda
          in rodent skull images with mean errors less than 500 um. This
          method is robust to different lighting conditions and mouse orientations,
          and has the potential to simplify the procedure of locating injection sites.

         <h4><a href="#msn">Spatial-temporal modeling of background radiation using mobile sensor networks</a></h4>
        <p>Modeling of background radiation for the urban environment plays an
          important role in homeland security. However, background radiation is
          difficult to assess due to its spatial-temporal fluctuations caused
          by the variation in soil composition, building materials, and weather
          patterns etc. To address the challenge of background radiation
          modeling, we developed a mobile sensor network to continuously monitor
          the background radiation; we also proposed a maximum likelihood estimation
          algorithm to decouple and estimate the background's spatial distribution
          and temporal fluctuation. Experimental results demonstrated how this
          background radiation monitoring system accurately recognized high
          background regions in the experimental area, and successfully captured
          temporal fluctuation trends of background radiation during rains. Our
          system provides an efficient solution to model the temporal fluctuation
          and spatial distribution of background radiation. [paper under review]</p>

         <h4><a href="#rl">Reinforcement learning for Radiation Source Detection</a></h4>
        <p>Anomalous radiation source detection in urban environment is challenging
          due to the complex nature of background radiation. When a suspicious area
          is determined, a radiation survey is usually carried out to search for
          anomalous radiation sources. To deliver a comprehensive and efficient
          survey, different survey approaches have been studied such as manually
          scanning the area by human or human operated robots, as well as
          automatically scanning the area with robots under the navigation of
          pre-defined survey paths. However, these two approaches either require
          human efforts or are not efficient and flexible enough to adjust
          survey paths based on recent measurements. Reinforcement learning,
          which studies the problem of how agents ought to take the optimized
          action so that a goal can be achieved efficiently, provides an
          alternative data-driven solution to conduct radiation detection tasks
          with no human intervention. In this paper, we apply reinforcement
          learning to navigate an automated agent searching for radiation
          sources. A simulated radiation environment is constructed, and
          Q-learning approaches are applied. Preliminary results show that
          Q-learning is able to navigate the agent to search for sources
          efficiently. [paper under review]</p>
